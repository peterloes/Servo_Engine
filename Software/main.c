 * <b>Description</b><br>
 * This is the firmware for project Servo_2015, a small board which allows to
 * control a servo via its PWM input.  Setup and control of the servo is done
 * via 3 keys, and, for selecting the two end positions, also via two external
 * inputs, please see below.  The firmware supports soft-start, i.e. the servo
 * speed will be ramped-up during the start phase.
 *
 * <b>Microcontroller</b><br>
 * The heart of the board is an EFM32G230 microcontroller.  It provides two
 * different clock domains: All low-energy peripheral is clocked via a
 * 32.768kHz external XTAL.  The MCU and other high performance peripheral
 * uses a high-frequency clock.  The board must be configured to use the
 * external 32MHz XTAL for that purpose, set define @ref USE_EXT_32MHZ_CLOCK
 * to 1.
 *
 * <b>Keys (Push Buttons)</b><br>
 * There exist 3 push buttons on the board.  When asserted, the following
 * action will be taken:
 * - In setup mode, S1 increases the current value, this can be the servo
 *   position, or the servo speed.  If the key is kept asserted, autorepeat
 *   gets active.  During normal operation, S1 lets the servo move to end
 *   position 2.
 * - In setup mode, S2 decreases the current value, this can be the servo
 *   position, or the servo speed.  If the key is kept asserted, autorepeat
 *   gets active.  During normal operation, S2 lets the servo move to end
 *   position 1.
 * - S3 changes between the setup modes, these are: end position 1, end
 *   position 2, speed selection, exit (storing values in FLASH).
 *
 * If no key has been asserted for more than 30 seconds, the setup mode is
 * aborted and the firmware returns to normal operation.
 *
 * <b>Setup Mode</b><br>
 * The servo setup procedure consists of 4 steps:
 * -# Adjust end position 1.  This can be the most left or the most right end
 *    point.  This position will be reached after power-up if valid servo data
 *    has been found in FLASH.
 * -# Adjust end position 2.  This is the opposite end position to position 1.
 * -# Adjust servo speed.  The servo permanently moves between the two end
 *    points.  The speed can be adjusted via S1 and S2.
 * -# Asserting S3 the 4th time stores the servo parameters into FLASH and
 *    returns to normal operation.
 *
 * <b>LEDs</b><br>
 * There is just one red LED connected to GPIO port PC0.
 * - It is enabled for a short time during power-up to show the board is
 *   healthy.
 * - During the servo setup, the LED shows the current mode (1 to 3) by
 *   flashing the respective number of times, followed by a pause.
  *
 * <b>External Inputs</b><br>
 * In normal operation mode, the servo can also be controlled via two external
 * inputs, these are:
 * - Port PC6 is equivalent to S1, a low edge signal lets the servo move to end
 *   position 2 (this port may also be used as SDA for an I2C connection).
 * - Port PC7 is equivalent to S2, a low edge signal lets the servo move to end
 *   position 1 (this port may also be used as SCL for an I2C connection).
 *
 * <b>Firmware</b><br>
 * The firmware consists of an initialization part and a main loop, also called
 * service execution loop.  The initialization part sets up all modules, enables
 * devices and interrupts.  The service execution loop handles all tasks that
 * must not be executed in interrupt context.
 *
 * After power-up or reset the following actions are performed:
 * -# Basic initialization of MCU and clocks
 * -# LED is switched on for test purposes (lamp test)
 * -# Further hardware initialization (Keys, Interrupts, Alarm Clock)
 * -# LED is switched off
 * -# If no valid servo parameters have been found, setup mode 1 is activated,
 *    the LED flashes one time, followed by a pause.
 * -# If valid servo parameters exist, the servo moves to end position 1.
 *
 * The program then enters the Service Execution Loop which takes care of:
 * - Servo setup or control (interrupt driven, runs in background)
 * - Entering the right energy mode

/*! @brief Modules that require EM1.
 *
 * This global variable is a bit mask for all modules that require EM1.
 * Standard peripherals would stop working in EM2 because clocks, etc. are
 * disabled.  Therefore it is required for software modules that make use
 * of such devices, to set the appropriate bit in this mask, as long as they
 * need EM1.  This prevents the power management of this application to enter
 * EM2.  The enumeration @ref EM1_MODULES lists those modules.
 * Low-Power peripherals, e.g. the RTC still work in EM1.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
   @code
   // Module Servo requires EM1, set bit in bit mask
   Bit(g_EM1_ModuleMask, EM1_MOD_SERVO) = 1;
   ...
   // Module Servo is no longer active, clear bit in bit mask
   Bit(g_EM1_ModuleMask, EM1_MOD_SERVO) = 0;
