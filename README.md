# SERVO Engine

Platform for Animal Manipulation 

This is the firmware for project Servo_2015, a small board which allows to
control a servo via its PWM input. Setup and control of the servo is done
via 3 keys, and, for selecting the two end positions, also via two external
inputs, please see below. The firmware supports soft-start, i.e. the servo
speed will be ramped-up during the start phase.
 

Supported:
- HITEC HS-5646WP

 Setup Mode
 
 The servo setup procedure consists of 4 steps:
 - Adjust end position 1.  This can be the most left or the most right end
   point.  This position will be reached after power-up if valid servo data
   has been found in FLASH.
 - Adjust end position 2.  This is the opposite end position to position 1.
 - Adjust servo speed.  The servo permanently moves between the two end
   points.  The speed can be adjusted via S1 and S2.
 - Asserting S3 the 4th time stores the servo parameters into FLASH and
   returns to normal operation
